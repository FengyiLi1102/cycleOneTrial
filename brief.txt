In this coding challenge, you will be asked to use what you have learned so far
to try and "computationally" solve a realistic problem in materials science.

The problem is the following.

A materials exists that is able to trap bacteria on it. This coating can be deposited as a series of N stripes of 
width d, and N+1 stripes (without coating) of width d2, so that N*d + (N+1)*d2 = L, L being the size of the 
surface, a square of L*L. We would like to understand what is the best value in terms of N and d that will allow 
to make bacteria die faster.

Why would bacteria die faster when trapped? Mainly, because they have less space to find food required to survive.
At the same time, bacteria that are close to each other can form stronger colonies, in the sense that the probability
for a bacteria to die because it has no food will depend on how many are present in its colony, so over-concentrating them in a single region
might not be the best thing to do.

Your "playground" for testing is a model where you have different colonies of bacteria (we'll specify it in a 
second), residing on a square surface (your material) which has N stripes each of size d of coating. Beside
bacteria, the surface also contains food.


You are given the following rules for the behaviour of bacteria.

1) Each bacteria have a rate k_die that it will die. This means that in a time-step dt, the bacteria will die
   with probability k_die( xx ). xx is the number of neighbours for a certain bacteria. This number is the 
   number of bacteria whose Voronoi cell (considering only bacteria of the same colony) is adjacent to the 
   Voronoi cell of the bacteria (i.e., they share an edge). The formula for it is
   k_die( xx ) = k_die( 0 ) / xx 

2) A bacteria can duplicate with a rate k_replicate.

3) A bacteria can move with rate k_move. If it moves, its displacement in the x and y direction is taken 
   taken from a Gaussian probability with mean = X and standard deviation = sigma  normal( mean, std ) -
   note that DX and DY must be taken independently.
   Importantly, if a bacteria is inside a coated region, the movement is allowed only if it keeps the bacteria 
   in the coated region and rejected otherwise. A movement is also rejected if it brings the bacteria outside 
   the surface.

In practice, this means that at each step of evolution, you should pick for every bacteria 1) or 2) or 3) based
on the formula

p_i = k_i / sum(i) k_i, i=1,3 and p_i is the probability to do the corresponding action


4) If a bacteria lands within a distance R_eat of a piece of food, it eats it (immediately, in the same step). 
   A bacteria that has just eaten cannot die for the next 10 steps.


COLONY:
Each bacteria belongs to one colony. The area of the colony is defined as the area of the convex hull 
formed by the bacteria. Different bacterial colonies can interact with each other if their convex hull 
overlaps( see Note 1 below ). The interaction between colonies can be different. 

If the colonies interact in synergy, once they overlap they merge together in a single colony.
If colonies compete, if they overlap bacteria kill each other through a fight (all within the same evolution step) 
until their colonies do not overlap anymore in the following way: two bacteria (1 and 2), taken one each 
randomly from the two different colonies fight each other based on their strength (S_1 or S_2). In practice, 
the surviror is taken randomly with a probability that is proportional to p_1 =  S_1 / ( S_1 + S_2 ) and 
p_2 = 1 - p_1


PREPARE THE SYSTEM in a configuration

SIMULATE TO MEASURE T_1/2, the time it takes so that the total number of bacteria decreases to half its
initial value.

FIND A VALUE FOR T_1/2 for 100 different (N,d) combinations. You must run many simulations, until the 
value found for T_(1/2) is known with a standard deviation smaller than 0.2 T_1/2.

Interpolate T_1/2( N, dd ) and use the interpolation function to determine its minimum

Finally, make sure to print out the system state and visualize it as a series of convex hulls every 200 evolution
steps. Besides that, also print another file where the position of each of the bacteria in the colony is given,
as well as the food. You can do that in a file with format:
Row 1: N_bacteria (total number) + N_food
Row 2: empty
Row 3: Symbol x y z
(the same for ) N_bacteria + N_food + 2 rows.
Symbol can be any element from the periodic table. Bacteria of different colonies should have different symbols.
Food should have a different symbol too.




SYSTEM PREPARATION:





VALUE OF PARAMETERS:

k_die(0) = 5
k_move = 50
k_replicate = 5
R_eat = 1

Surface is a 2D square of 10 x 10

Simulation 1: 
5 synergistic colonies of 100 bacteria each. Initially, each colony should be put randomly on the surface 
so that all its bacteria are in a circle of radius 2. Within the circle, bacteria have random positions

Simulation 2:
As in in Simulation 1, but for competitive colonies. 

Food:
Put in each case 2000 food particles randomly on the surface.

Strength (for fights only): the strength of a bacteria in a colony is given by 

10 / N_life + sqrt( N_colony ) + 10 / N_no_eat

where N_life is the evolution steps passed since the bacteria is born (note that once a bacteria divide
one of the copy has age 0, the other keeps its previous age ), N_colony is the number of bacteria in the 
colony and N_no_eat the number of steps passed since the bacteria has eaten.
